wassup.lua is a script performing a wireless AP scan and presenting it
in a readable text format.

It depends on lua(1) and either iw(8), iwlist(8) or libiwinfo.
It's intended to run as root which is needed for active scanning.

Originally written on and for use with OpenWrt, but should run on any
platform that features the above tools. Tested on Debian.

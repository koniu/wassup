### Dependencies

The only dependencies are `Lua 5.1` and one of the following backends:

  * `iwlist(8)` - from `wireless-tools`, based on wext and pretty standard
  * `iw(8)` - `nl80211` based utility, common on modern systems
  * `wpa_cli(8)` - `wpa_supplicant` command-line interface
  * `libiwinfo` - nice abstraction library available in OpenWrt trunk
  * `airport` - standard OSX command line utility

It's intended to run as root - needed for active scanning.

Originally written on and for use with OpenWrt, but should run on any
platform that features the above tools. Tested on Debian and OSX 10.6.5.
